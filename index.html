<h1>Allie's Summer Vacation</h1>

<p>This summer was full of many great memories. I travelled to places <br>like <b>Puerto Rico</b>, 
<b>California</b> and <b>Orlando</b>.</br></p> 

<h2>Puerto Rico</h2> 

<p>During June, I travelled to Puerto Rico--where I've lived for most of my life--to visit family
and friends. <br>It was an endearing experience because I had not seen them in a while. We hung out at popular places like:</br> </p>

<a href="https://sanjuanpuertorico.com/old-san-juan/">Viejo San Juan</a> </h3> 
<h3>
<a href="http://www.puertoricodaytrips.com/playa-sardinera-hatillo/">Playa Sardinera</a> </h3>
<h3> 
<a href="http://www.tropicaltrailrides.com/">Horseback riding in Isabella</a> </h3>

<p>My friends and I ate popsicles from a really good shop called <b>"Se√±or Paleta."</b> I also visited my greatgrandma,
whom <br>I had not seen in a while. I was in Puerto Rico for almost 3 weeks before I had to head back home.</br></p>

 

<h2>California</h2> 

<p>After Puerto Rico, I headed off back home to pack my bags and leave to California for 5 weeks. I had received 
scholarship <br>from the California College of the Arts to attend a Pre-college program. The college is located in 
Oakland, CA, right next to </br> San Francisco. In the program, I met so many increbibly talented and kind people whom have 
stayed in contact with me to this day.</br> </P> 

<br> 

My Summer overall was an amazing, fortunate and even eye-opening experience. <br>I hope that the next one will be the same or better yet.</p>
